            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, sift together 2 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 ½ cups of granulated sugar, ¾ cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 ½ teaspoons of baking powder, and 1 ½ teaspoons of baking soda.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together 2 large eggs, 1 cup of milk, ½ cup of vegetable oil, and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until the batter is smooth and well combined.</li>
            <li>Stir in 1 cup of boiling water to the batter. The batter will be thin, but that's normal.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter evenly into the prepared cake pans.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for approximately 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Once the cakes are cooled, you can frost them with your favorite chocolate frosting or ganache.</li>
            <li>Slice and serve this decadent chocolate cake to enjoy its moist and chocolaty goodness!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note: Feel free to get creative by adding additional layers, fillings, or decorations as desired. Enjoy your homemade chocolate cake!</p>
