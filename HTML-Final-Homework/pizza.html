        <h3><strong>Chocolate Cake</strong></h3>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can reach (usually around 475°F to 500°F or 245°C to 260°C).</li>
            <li>Prepare the pizza dough by combining 2 ¼ teaspoons of active dry yeast, 1 ½ cups of warm water, 1 teaspoon of sugar, and 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a mixing bowl. Let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is activated and foamy.</li>
            <li>Gradually add 4 cups of all-purpose flour and 1 ½ teaspoons of salt to the yeast mixture. Stir until the dough comes together, then transfer it onto a floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 to 1 ½ hours, or until it doubles in size.</li>
            <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into two equal portions. Roll out each portion into a desired pizza shape on a floured surface.</li>
            <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough onto a baking sheet or a pizza stone. If using a baking sheet, lightly grease it or line it with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Spread your favorite pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Then add your desired toppings such as cheese, vegetables, meats, and herbs.</li>
            <li>Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
            <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. This will help the toppings set and make it easier to slice.</li>
            <li>Slice the pizza into wedges or squares, serve, and enjoy your homemade, piping hot pizza!</li>
          </ol>
        <p>Note: Feel free to experiment with different toppings and flavor combinations to suit your preferences. Bon appétit!</p>
